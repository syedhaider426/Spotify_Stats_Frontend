# Spotify Stats Frontend
Spotify Stats Frontend (https://spotify-stats-graph.link) was developed in ReactJS. It was designed with MaterialUI and uses Vega library for the charts (https://github.com/vega/react-vega). This website allows users to view the audio features for an artist throughout their entire discography range (from the time of their first song released to most recent song released). In addition, if a user cannot find a specific artist, they can submit a request to get that artist's discography and their audio features. After the songs are found, the user can view that artist on the homepage. 

# Features
1) Users can search for specific artists. 
2) Users can view the audio features for an artist's discography. 
3) Users can click on each data point that will redirect them to the song on Spotify.
4) Users can add new artists which are on Spotify.
